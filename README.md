## ‚úÖ Features

### Open Source

The SSI Verifier is completely open-source. Feel free to contribute, request features, or deploy your own instance.

### Privacy Preserving

Presentations of credentials are highly sensitive data. Therefore, we immediately forward the data to the verifier
who requested the presentation and do not store it in the application itself.

### SSI Standard Agnostic

The SSI Verifier aims to support a variety of SSI credential formats like AnonCreds, JWT Credentials, and BBS+/JSON-LD Credentials. focuses on connectionless proof requests of any
type of verifiable credential.

### Integrated UI and Optimized for Mobile Devices

The SSI Verifier comes with a UI that allows one to use the SSI Verifier without requiring any integration
into the own systems. Moreover, the UI is optimized for mobile devices. In case you want to verify credentials on the go
using your smartphone you now have the chance.

### Many APIs

To integrate the SSI Verifier into you existing systems a variety of API interfaces exist:

- **HTTP API**: Generate new proof requests based on existing proof templates and show them to your user in your own application or even in an email.
- **Webhook and WebSocket Interfaces**: Be notified whenever a new presentation arrives.
- **Open ID Connect Identity Provider (OIDC IdP):** Authenticate and authorize users based on verifiable credentials.

## üöÄ Try it!

Feel free to try out the SSI Verifier here: https://app.ssi-verifier.com

The SSI Verifier is **connected to the IDunion Test Ledger**. When requesting attributes from credentials please ensure that you are referencing credential definitions or schemas that are published on
the IDunion Test Ledger. To view all credential definitions and schemas published on the IDunion Test Ledger use one of the two ledger viewers:

- [Indyscan](https://idunion.esatus.com/home/IDunion_Test)
- [BcGov Viewer](https://idu.cloudcompass.ca/)

As an SSI wallet we recommend using the **Lissi Wallet**: https://lissi.id

## üßê FAQ

### What is used to build the SSI Verifier?

The SSI Verifier is a Spring Boot application with a server-side rendered web application. To offer a SPA-like user experience [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) is leveraged. To create proof
requests and verify presentations the [AcaPy](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) is used.
Finally, the proof templates are stored in a Postgres database.

### How can I deploy my own instance of the SSI Verifier?

You can find more information about how to build and run your own instance [here](./docs/Build%20and%20Run.md).

### Do I have to deploy my own instance or can I use the public instance?

The instance hosted under [app.ssi-verifier.com](https://app.ssi-verifier.com) exists to be used. Feel free to use it in case you have any use cases you would like to test out.

### Is the presentation data stored permanently?

Due to the sensitivity of the data shared in presentations, the data will only be shared with your own session and immediately removed from the server. This also means that the presentation
data will be inaccessible in case the browser session is exited before the presentation data was shared by the holder.
